# Statiki

A static wiki generator built in go.

## Rationale

There are a [lot](http://staticsitegenerators.net/) of 
[static site generators] (http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html) 
out there already.  Why create a new one?

Because none of them work the way I want them to.

## Features

1. Automatic generation of list pages
2. Custom taxonomies
3. Full text search functionality (with javascript)
4. Templates built with [amber](https://github.com/eknkc/amber)
5. An extendable markdown parser (eventually)

## Progress

This is a brand new project, and there isn't anything useful here yet.  Give me a few days at least.
